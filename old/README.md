Pencil-Bot is a semi customizable bot that can be customized to your needs. Pencil-Bot's main focus isn't rather to have a bot that has 
set modules for you to enable/disable but rather as a base bot that can be easily modified to include custom features built by the user.

### Pencil-Bot Modules

Pencil-bot has some default modules/functions that can prepepared for you.

The default set of modules includes and it's not limited to:

* Google Search
